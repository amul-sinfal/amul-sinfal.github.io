## üëã About me

I have strong expertise in **manual testing** and over 1 year of experience in **automation testing** with Selenium WebDriver, and API testing using Postman. My experience includes working with **Agile methodologies**, collaborating with cross-functional teams to ensure software quality by identifying defects, validating functionality, and contributing to test planning for seamless software delivery.

As an aspiring automation tester, I have created projects to demonstrate my skills in **Core Java**, **Selenium WebDriver**, **TestNG**, and **Postman**, which I have uploaded on **GitHub** . I am continuously enhancing my skills by working on automation projects, exploring advanced test frameworks, and staying updated with modern testing tools. I am passionate about improving test efficiency through automation and actively expanding my knowledge to keep up with evolving industry trends.

I hold industry-recognized certifications, including the **Agile Tester Foundation Extension Certificate in Software Testing** and the **Foundation Level Certificate in Software Testing**. These certifications validate my expertise in software testing principles, Agile methodologies, and structured testing approaches.

My objective is to secure a role in an organization where I can grow as an automation tester while also contributing my expertise in manual testing. I aim to contribute to a team that prioritizes software quality, and values continuous learning to deliver robust and reliable software solutions.
